Ever encountered the dreaded `Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000` when trying to start your Next.js development server? Here's a quick solution to add to your `package.json` scripts.

## The Problem

When developing with Next.js, sometimes the development server doesn't shut down properly, leaving port 3000 occupied. This commonly happens when:

- Your terminal crashes unexpectedly
- You force-quit the development process
- A previous session is still running in the background

## The Solution

Add this script to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "kill": "lsof -t -i tcp:3000 | xargs kill"
  }
}
```

Now you can simply run:

```bash
npm run kill
# or
yarn kill
# or
pnpm kill
```

## How It Works

Let's break down the command:

1. `lsof -t -i tcp:3000`: Lists process IDs using port 3000
2. `xargs kill`: Takes those IDs and kills the processes

## When You Need This

This command is particularly helpful when:

- Switching between multiple Next.js projects
- After system sleep/wake cycles
- When your development environment crashes
- Hot reloading stops working

Add it to your development toolkit, and you'll never have to manually hunt down and kill those pesky port processes again!

_Note: This command works on Unix-based systems (macOS, Linux). For Windows, you'll need a different approach using `netstat` and `taskkill`._
