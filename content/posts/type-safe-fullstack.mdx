Imagine catching API integration errors before they hit production, having perfect autocompletion for your backend endpoints, and never having to manually update API types again. This isn't just a dream - it's possible with end-to-end type safety. In this post, I'll show you how I built a fully type-safe system that bridges Python and TypeScript, making full-stack development a breeze.

## Why This Matters: Real-World Impact

Before we dive into the implementation, let's look at how this setup transforms your development experience:

### 1. Catch Errors Early

```typescript
// Without type safety - Problems only appear at runtime 😱
const response = await api.get("/user/123");
console.log(response.data.emailAddress); // Runtime error: undefined

// With our type-safe SDK ✨
const user = await sdk.users.getUser(123);
console.log(user.email); // TypeScript error if you try to access wrong property
```

### 2. Perfect Autocompletion

Your IDE instantly shows you:

- All available API endpoints
- Required parameters and their types
- Response data structure
- Validation rules from your Python models

### 3. Automatic Updates

When you modify your FastAPI models:

```python
class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    is_active: bool
    # Add a new field
    role: UserRole
```

The TypeScript types automatically update:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  isActive: boolean;
  role: UserRole; // ✨ Automatically added!
}
```

### 4. Developer Experience

- No more API documentation hunting
- Instant feedback on invalid API usage
- Confident refactoring across the stack
- Seamless team collaboration between frontend and backend

## The Challenge

When building full-stack applications with different languages (Python for backend and TypeScript for frontend), maintaining type safety across the boundary can be challenging. Common issues include:

- Manually keeping types in sync
- Runtime type errors from API responses
- Inconsistent API documentation
- Time-consuming SDK maintenance

## The Solution: Our Tech Stack

We'll use:

```txt
- Backend: `Python` with `FastAPI`
- Frontend: TypeScript with `Next.js` or `React` or `Expo` (works with any ts/js framework)
- Tools: `Turborepo`, `hey-api`, and `pnpm`
```

## Setting Up the Project Structure

You have two options for organizing your codebase:

### Option 1: Monorepo Structure

```bash
apps/
  ├── web/          # Next.js frontend
  └── api/          # FastAPI backend (optional)
packages/
  └── sdk/          # Generated TypeScript SDK
```

### Option 2: Separate Repositories

```bash
# Frontend Monorepo
apps/
  └── web/          # Next.js frontend
packages/
  └── sdk/          # Generated TypeScript SDK

# Separate Backend Repository
fastapi-backend/    # FastAPI backend in its own repository
```

The beauty of this setup is that it doesn't matter where your FastAPI backend lives - all we need is access to its OpenAPI specification URL. This flexibility allows you to:

1. Keep the backend in the same monorepo for tighter integration
2. Maintain it in a separate repository for independent scaling
3. Even use an existing FastAPI service - as long as you have access to its OpenAPI spec

The SDK generation process remains the same regardless of where your FastAPI backend is hosted. This is particularly useful when:

- Working with existing backend services
- Different teams manage frontend and backend
- You need different deployment cycles for frontend and backend
- The backend needs to be used by multiple frontend applications

## Backend: FastAPI with Type Definitions

In our FastAPI application, we define our models using Pydantic:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    is_active: bool

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/users/{user_id}", response_model=User)
async def get_user(user_id: int) -> User:
    # Database logic here
    return User(
        id=user_id,
        name="John Doe",
        email="john@example.com",
        is_active=True
    )
```

FastAPI automatically generates an OpenAPI specification from our code:

```json
{
  "components": {
    "schemas": {
      "User": {
        "properties": {
          "id": { "type": "integer" },
          "name": { "type": "string" },
          "email": { "type": "string" },
          "is_active": { "type": "boolean" }
        },
        "required": ["id", "name", "email", "is_active"],
        "type": "object"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Generating the SDK with hey API

hey API makes it easy to generate a type-safe SDK from our OpenAPI spec. Here's our configuration:

```typescript
// openapi-ts.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@hey-api/openapi-ts";
import "dotenv/config";

export default defineConfig({
  name: "acmeSDK",
  input: process.env.OPENAPI_URL || "https://localhost:8000/openapi.json",
  output: "src",
  client: "axios",
});
```

We also need to set up our SDK package configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "@acme/sdk",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "./src/index.ts",
  "exports": {
    ".": "./src/index.ts"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "openapi-ts",
    "gen": "openapi-ts",
    "build": "openapi-ts"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@hey-api/client-axios": "^0.2.7",
    "@tanstack/react-query": "^5.56.2",
    "axios": "^0.27.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@hey-api/openapi-ts": "^0.52.11",
    "@types/node": "^20.12.8",
    "dotenv": "^16.4.5"
  }
}
```

## SDK Initialization and Configuration

Before we can use the SDK, we need to add it as a dependency in our client application's `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "@acme/web",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@acme/sdk": "workspace:*",
    "next": "latest",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  }
}
```

The `workspace:*` syntax tells pnpm to use the local workspace version of the SDK, which is essential for monorepo setups.

Now we can set up our SDK with interceptors for authentication and error handling:

```typescript
// sdk/client.ts
import { acmeSDK, OpenAPI } from "@acme/sdk";

// Set up request interceptor for authentication
OpenAPI.interceptors.request.use((options) => {
  options.headers = options.headers ?? {};
  options.headers = {
    ...options.headers,
    Authorization: `Bearer ${/* your auth token */}`,
  };
  return options;
});

// Set up response interceptor for error handling
OpenAPI.interceptors.response.use((response) => {
  if (!response || response.status >= 400) {
    // Handle authentication errors
    if (response.status === 401) {
      window.location.assign("/api/auth/login");
    }
    throw new Error(`Request failed with status ${response?.status}`);
  }
  return response;
});

// Initialize the SDK with base URL and interceptors
const sdk = new acmeSDK({
  BASE: process.env.API_URL ?? "http://localhost:8080",
  interceptors: {
    request: OpenAPI.interceptors.request,
    response: OpenAPI.interceptors.response,
  },
});

export { sdk };
```

This setup provides:

- Automatic authentication token injection
- Global error handling
- Environment-based API URL configuration
- Type-safe request and response handling

## Using the Generated SDK in Next.js

Now we can use our type-safe SDK in our Next.js application. The method names in the SDK are automatically derived from the operation IDs defined in our FastAPI backend:

```typescript
import { sdk } from "@/lib/sdk";
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import type { User } from "@acme/sdk";

export default function UserProfile({ userId }: { userId: number }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User>();

  useEffect(() => {
    // The method name 'getUser' comes from the operationId in FastAPI
    // @app.get("/users/{user_id}", operation_id="getUser")
    async function fetchUser() {
      try {
        const user = await sdk.users.getUser(userId);
        setUser(user);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Failed to fetch user:", error);
      }
    }

    fetchUser();
  }, [userId]);

  return (
    <div>
      {user && (
        <>
          <h1>{user.name}</h1>
          <p>{user.email}</p>
          <span>{user.is_active ? "Active" : "Inactive"}</span>
        </>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

The SDK methods are organized by resource (like `users`, `posts`, etc.) and the method names are derived from the operation IDs in your FastAPI routes. For example:

```python
# In your FastAPI backend
@app.get("/users/{user_id}", operation_id="getUser")
async def get_user(user_id: int) -> User:
    ...

@app.post("/users", operation_id="createUser")
async def create_user(user: UserCreate) -> User:
    ...

# These become available in your SDK as:
# sdk.users.getUser(userId)
# sdk.users.createUser(userCreateData)
```

This naming convention ensures consistent and predictable API method names across your entire application.

## Automating SDK Generation

We can automate SDK generation in our Turborepo pipeline:

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**", ".next/**"]
    },
    "generate-sdk": {
      "cache": false
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Type Safety**: Complete type safety from backend to frontend
2. **Developer Experience**: Autocomplete and type checking in your IDE
3. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for API types
4. **Productivity**: Automated SDK generation saves development time
5. **Documentation**: OpenAPI spec serves as living documentation

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions
