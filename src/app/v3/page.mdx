## Welcome to My Personal Blog

Hello, fellow web enthusiasts! I'm Abhay Ramesh, a passionate full stack web developer who loves building exceptional web experiences. I also have a strong affinity for self-hosting, where I manage my own server infrastructure and explore the endless possibilities it offers.

Let's dive into what makes me tick:

- **Full Stack Web Development:**  
  I find joy in every aspect of web development, from designing elegant user interfaces with <a className="underline decoration-sky-500 decoration-2">Next.js</a>, React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to building powerful backend systems using Python (FastAPI), Node.js, and Express.js.

- **Thriving on <a class="underline decoration-sky-500 decoration-2">Self-Hosting</a>:**  
  Taking control of my online presence and building my own server infrastructure is thrilling. I enjoy deploying applications using Docker Compose and leveraging cloud services like <a class="underline decoration-sky-500 decoration-2">AWS</a> (Lambda, S3, SNS, SES) for optimal performance and scalability.

- **Constantly Exploring:**  
  I'm always on the lookout for the latest tools and technologies that enhance my web development journey. I embrace Let's Encrypt for SSL/TLS certificates and rely on Cloudflare for DNS management and content delivery. I also experiment with n8n for workflow automation and monitor applications with Uptime Kuma and Speedtest Monitoring.

Join me on this exciting journey as we:

- Learn together
- Explore new frontiers
- Share experiences and insights
- Inspire and empower fellow developers
