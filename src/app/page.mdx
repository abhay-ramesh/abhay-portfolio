![Profile Picture](your-profile-picture-url)

## Welcome to My Personal Blog!

Hello, fellow web enthusiasts! I'm Abhay Ramesh, a passionate full stack web developer who loves building exceptional web experiences. I also have a strong affinity for self-hosting, where I manage my own server infrastructure and explore the endless possibilities it offers.

Let's dive into what makes me tick:

- **Full Stack Web Development:** I find joy in every aspect of web development, from designing elegant user interfaces with Next.js, React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to building powerful backend systems using Python (FastAPI), Node.js, and Express.js.

- **Thriving on Self-Hosting:** Taking control of my online presence and building my own server infrastructure is thrilling. I enjoy deploying applications using Docker Compose and leveraging cloud services like AWS (Lambda, S3, SNS, SES) for optimal performance and scalability.

- **Constantly Exploring:** I'm always on the lookout for the latest tools and technologies that enhance my web development journey. I embrace Let's Encrypt for SSL/TLS certificates and rely on Cloudflare for DNS management and content delivery. I also experiment with n8n for workflow automation and monitor applications with Uptime Kuma and Speedtest Monitoring.

Join me on this exciting journey as we:

- Learn together
- Explore new frontiers
- Share experiences and insights
- Inspire and empower fellow developers
